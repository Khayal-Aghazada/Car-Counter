## About the Project

**Car Counter CV** is a Python-based computer vision application that automatically detects and counts cars in video streams. Designed for traffic analysis, smart city applications, and educational purposes, this tool leverages OpenCV and custom tracking modules to provide accurate, real-time vehicle counting from both video files and live camera feeds.

### What Does It Do?
- **Detects cars** in each frame of a video or webcam stream using advanced image processing and object detection techniques.
- **Tracks vehicles** as they move through the frame, ensuring each car is counted only once.
- **Counts cars** crossing a virtual line or region, providing live statistics for traffic monitoring or data collection.
- **Visualizes results** by overlaying bounding boxes, counts, and other helpful graphics on the video output.

This project is modular and easy to extend, making it suitable for:
- Traffic flow analysis
- Parking lot management
- Smart city research
- Educational demonstrations of computer vision techniques

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-counter-cv.git
cd car-counter-cv
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed.  
Install required packages (example using pip):

```sh
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

*(Add any other dependencies your project uses.)*

### 3. Run the Car Counter

To run the car counter on a demo video:

```sh
python -m apps.car_counter --mirror 0
```

- You can modify the script to use your own video files or webcam.
- Example videos are available in `assets/demo_video/`.

### 4. Project Customization

- The main logic is in the `modules` directory.  
- You can extend the functionality by modifying or adding modules.

## Example Usage

```sh
python -m apps.car_counter --mirror 0
```
